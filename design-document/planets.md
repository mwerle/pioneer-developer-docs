# Planetary terrain generation

- **Planetary terrain generation** - is closely tied to that and it would be nice to up the fidelity of it
  - Could feel less noise-based with real world inspired erosion and geological patterns and biome coloring
  - Ground scatter would be nice. Both rocks and other debris and vegetation
  - Water and other bodies of liquids would be nice too
  - Weather patterns and clouds too

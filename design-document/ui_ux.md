# **UI-UX**

- We are at a nice place with that mostly, but there's still a lot of room for improvement.

- Ability to control as much functionality as possible from a joystick with a hat switch and buttons  without contorting the UI into weird yoga positions like E:D does.
- HUD is a nice basis. There's room for added functionality
  - There could be proper comms (see above - non-combat gameplay)
  - HUD for external docking
- Flight UX is quite nice with the new flight computer. There's room for a bit of polish, but it's really nice overall.
- Station screens could benefit from some facelift and UX improvement
- Maps even more so (see also flight planning points)
- Interactive cockpits for more immersive gameplay. But optional, one should be able to play the game with only a HUD as well.

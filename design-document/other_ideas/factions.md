## Faction Heraldry
Each faction should have some sort of banner/symbol/flag with which we can decorate the station screen. It needs to be something we can generate from the rest of the Faction information so we don't have to hand make a custom image for each faction. So a heraldic system where you build it up from a small set of symbols and colours, as was used in [The Lords of Midnight](http://www.icemark.com/tower/WhosWho/whoswho.htm) back in the day, seems like the way to go.

See the wikipedia article on [Heraldry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry) for more ideas.

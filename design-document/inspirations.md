# Inspiration

- [Frontier: Elite II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier:_Elite_II). by David Braben and Ian Bell - the seed of Pioneer Space sim, which started as [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) re-implemetation of Frontier.
- [Independence War 1. and 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_War_2:_Edge_of_Chaos). by Particle Systems - these games have very a satisfying flight model and enjoyable combat
- [The Expanse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series)) by James S. A. Corey and the [TV series adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)) - the nitty-gritty of spaceflight here is quite similar to what Pioneer has
- [Atomic Rockets](http://projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/) by Winchell Chung - a treasure trove of information about  the science of space flight and spaceships both real world and sci-fi
- Elite: Dangerous - has some interesting gameplay and visual ideas. Also, a descendant of Frontier, which is sure something!
- Star Citizen - the complex one, albeit we do not strive for this kind of detail. There are some nice visual workflow ideas in there as well
- Nebulous: Space Combat - the interface can give some nice ideas about overview/management level interfaces, and combat is very detailed
- Dwarf Fortress :P - mostly the systemic/emergent gameplay aspect
- List to be expanded, especially with non-spacesim games for the other parts

## **Ship design and visual language**

- Ships should have a somewhat believable structure and looks, but not aiming for 100% realism. RCS thrusters, appropriately sized main thrusters, visible sensor and similar equipment and such. 
- I am aiming for a bit more subtle, but unique visuals. See the reworked OPLI ships. The aim is to have distinct visuals, with not too much over-the-topness.
- Will elaborate more in a proper visual bible. (Which I've ought to have done already)
- There should be lots of sketches and concept art in that visual bible. See the point about very rough blockouts of ships. I'd say if we can put down a good list of balanced ships that way, we can then provide descriptions for them, which could also be an incentive for artists to contribute sketches.

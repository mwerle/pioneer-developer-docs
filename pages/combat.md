## Combat

- Another aspect that is important to a lot of people. Especially close quarters combat, because that's where the thrill is. The above ship system granularity is a huge part of this, especially the hardpoints. Right now about every ship can have one front and one rear cannon and a given amount of missiles, which isn't good for ship differentiation either. *Would need proper design, and will be a huge multi-faceted project.*

- Multiple hardpoints per ship, with size and such limits to differentiate ships more
- Turrets
- Different kinds of weapons with different up and downsides
- Sensors and detection
- Shields could work in a more unique manner, instead of just being a regenerating second health bar
- Maneuvering should be more important in combat. Figuring out a way to eliminate jousting as much as possible would be quite important important in my opinion.
- The above mentioned semi-turn based approach to intercepts could be interesting I think. Like if one wants to pirate, they'd pick a target, plan an intercept, and change that flight plan based on the reaction of the target. And manually finish the last leg of the intercept.
- Ship health would benefit from some thought also. The ability to mission-kill a ship by disabling engines for example would be nice. Or disarming them, or destroying a certain equipment of theirs that would keep them from fulfiling their task. Which could also happen to the player. --> ability to put out distress calls
- There are UI-UX considerations for combat as well, both regarding information provided, and aids for the actual combat, like lead indicators, motion trails and such.

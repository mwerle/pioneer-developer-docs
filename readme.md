# Pioneer Space Simulator
## Design document proposal

This repository is a design document proposal for the open source game Pioneer Space Simulator. The aim of the document is to define a vision for the game (albeit not too granular), to focus the development efforts for the team and to provide a good and welcoming starting point to aspiring contributors. It is relatively light on granular details to avoid turning contributing to Pioneer into a second job with deadlines and such nastiness.

### About Pioneer

[Pioneer Space Simulator](https://pioneerspacesim.net) is a open source space adventure game set in the Milkyway galaxy at the turn of the 33rd century. Originally Pioneer started out as an open source remake of Frontier: Elite II, initiated by Tom Morton sometime around 2010. Since then the team strives to widen the scope and are slowly maturing the game past its craddle, while honoring these initial traditions. 

Some things that inspire Pioneer:

- [Frontier: Elite II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier:_Elite_II). by David Braben and Ian Bell - the seed of all this
- [Independence War 1. and 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_War_2:_Edge_of_Chaos). by Particle Systems
- [The Expanse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series)) by James S. A. Corey and the [TV series adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series))
- [Atomic Rockets](http://projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/) by Winchell Chung
- Dwarf Fortress :P
- List to be expanded
